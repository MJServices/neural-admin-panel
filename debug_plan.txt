// Read env vars manually since this runs outside Next.js context easily or assume hardcoded for test if needed.
// Actually, better to run this via a temporary route or just strictly analyze the code. 
// I'll make a temporary debug file in the app to output console logs on server side.

// Skipping actual file creation for external script. Functional approach:
// I will start by adding console logs to the server action in app/actions.ts to see what supabase returns.
